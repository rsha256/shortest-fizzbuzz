# shortest-fizzbuzz
#### Contains shortest solutions to fizzbuzz in various programming languages

** **

## Rules:
"Write a program that prints the numbers from 1 to 100. But for multiples of three print “Fizz” instead of the number and for the multiples of five print “Buzz”. For numbers which are multiples of both three and five print “FizzBuzz”."

## Contributing:
1. Alphabetically add your addition here to [README.md](README.md) in the format `[<language name>](<file-name>), <number-of-bytes> bytes`. GitHub tells you the number of **bytes** for any file. 
2. Add a file to the root of the repo in the form of: `<language-name>.<file-extension>` that satisfies the rules above. 

## Notes:
Try to write a detailed commit message.

If possible make sure you end your file with a newline at the end and are using LF as opposed to CRLF Line sequences.

Feel free to improve on existing solutions if you can do better :)
